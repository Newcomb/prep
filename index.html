    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in sports you may want to keep track of your favorite players
    statistics. You could use a force chart to display this by entering the names of your
  favorite players as the node and you could connect them based on how closely their statistics are
or by whether or not they play on the same team. By connecting them to teammates and coloring them
that teams specific colors you could easily keep track of where they are. In addition, you could
set the radius equal to the statistic you want to keep track of in order to compare.</p>
<h2>Grades</h2>
<p>Another dataset you could display using a force chart are the grades a class scores. Each node could represent
one person from that class and they could be clustered based on the average of their scores. Increasing
the size of the radius or having a color gradient could represent changes in score.</p>
<h2>Stocks</h2>
<p>Stocks are always fluctuating so it would be amazing to have an easy way to keep track of
their changes. You could create a force chart with company names as the node and connect them
based on the type of company they are. Then you could style the data so that the coloring shows an increase or decrease
in stock price and makes it easy for you to see which company would be the best to invest in.</p>
<h2>Campus Housing</h2>
<p>Keeping track of where everyone lives is hard sometimes. In order to make it easier to remember where your
friends live you could create a dataset that has each friends name as a node and connects them to other friends
that live in the same dorms. Instead of using circles you could use headshots which would make it easy to identify
your friends. Then you could label each set of friends according to the dorm they live in.</p>
